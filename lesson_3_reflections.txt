When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share the project or to keep a safe version reachable from
    anywhere with an internet connection.
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When you are working on something in particular and you don't want that to be
    modified without your knowledge. Or to not have continiously internet traffic.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Copy of a repository from another user from GitHub at GitHub.
    Clones: A copy (remote or local) of another repository.
    Branch: A different path of the same repository.
    A branch is used to develop new ideas or separate workflows of the same project.
    With clone you can copy the content of a repository to work with it, and with fork
    you can acknowledge the author of another project where you want to continue your
    own work.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To work in an offline environment with all the updated information at that moment.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Talking with the collaborators in person or by e-mail. It would be less trackable,
    specially in large projects.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To preserve the master branch intact while working in new features, and to a better
    organization with other collaborators.

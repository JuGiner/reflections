What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It creates de folder .git with the data associated with git for a empty repository.
    To do it, you must execute the command "git init", and to see the status of the 
    new repository "git status".


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is where the files and documents that are going to be part of a commit
    stay before being commited. The working directory shows you all the elements you have 
    to work with, being part of the repository or not. And the repository keeps the commits 
    you make from the staging area.

change?
